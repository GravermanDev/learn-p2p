# Episode 1 - basics
This is the beginning of my series on peer-to-peer networks in Rust. The source code in this folder runs a simple `ping` example in libp2p.

## Video script
In this video I will show you the bacics of peer-to-peer networks. I'll give you actual examples in Rust code, with a library libp2p, however this knowledge will apply to other languages. I aim to make this a series, after which we can all develop decentralized systems.

It's important to note that this is also something new to me and I will make mistakes. Hopefully we can all learn, and maybe make a community project if the channel continues to grow. Let's get into it.
